Image Processing basics in Matlab

This repository includes the following Matlab codes:

1. Image read, write, resize
2. Distance between two images
3. Image Enhancement Operations - Negation, Thresholding, Contrast Stretching, Grey Level Slicing, Bit plane slicing of an image
4. Applying LPF, HPF and Median Filter for Gaussian Noise and Salt and Pepper Noise (3x3 and 5x5 masks)
5. Discrete Cosine Transform and Discrete Sine Transform
6. Apply 2 level decomposition using LPF and HPF filter Banks on given image
7. Image Segmentation Using Roberts, Prewitt And Sobel Operators â€ƒ
8. Morphology operations like Erosion, Dilation, Opening and Closing
